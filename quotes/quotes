There's no talent here, this is hard work. This is an obsession. Talent does not exist, we are all equals as human beings. You could be anyone if you put in the time. You could be anyone if you put in the time and that's that. I am not talented, I am obsessed
Nothing good ever comes from worrying or sitting there feeling sorry for yourself.. Keep positive and keep pushing on and things will turn good
Be grateful with everything you have and you will be successful in everything you do
Work hard, stay focussed, believe in yourself and listen to no one but yourself
Defeat is a secret ingredient to success
